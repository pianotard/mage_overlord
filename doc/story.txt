MC isekai-ed to a mage-dominated world

bad mages trying to wipe out other classes
good mages trying to prevent bad mages from wiping out other classes

global curse by bad mages prevents people from picking up other class weapons / using other class skills

MC wakes up in a wide opening in a forest
looks like something exploded

something scuttling behind the trees

turns out to be 2 cute animal children who are afraid of MC
children heard loud bang while playing in the forest and came to investigate, and found MC lying unconscious in the middle of the 'crater'
children were afraid to approach MC, fearing that MC is a bad mage

MC still has the packet of Calbee he was holding onto before being isekai-ed
offers some to children, after demonstrating that it is edible

children hesitantly accepted, and quickly warms up to MC
tries to show MC something cool

along the way, MC notices a shiny looking bow and picks it up
children give MC strange glances but say nothing wrt to the bow, continues conversation as per normal

suddenly 1 of the children falls into a pitfall trap set by hunters
horn sounds in the distance, indicating that hunters have been alerted
MC has to rescue child by gathering grass and making rope within time limit

1 hunter arrives as soon as child exits the pitfall trap, and MC has to fight them
children tells MC to use the bow, but MC replies that he has no arrows
children says that MC is able to pick up the bow, so he should be able to cast magic arrows by concentrating
MC manages to fire a homing arrow and defeats the hunter, and collapses from exhaustion

upon waking up, MC finds himself in a bed
apparently children led a semi-conscious MC back to their home

over dinner, children's parents thank MC for saving their child
MC reveals that he has no idea how he ended up here, and he just woke up in the forest clearing
parents explain the state of the world, good mages vs bad mages etc
parents also explain that it is uncommon to see a bow-wielding mage, but not unheard of (magic arrows)
	but bad mages refuse to wield bows, and instead cast spells to mimic the effect, therefore MC must be good
the village that MC is currently in is a good mage village, and parents recommend MC to visit the chief to make sense of his situation
MC offers some money for their hospitality, and parents remark that they've never seen that currency before..

the next day, MC visits the chief
chief has been expecting MC after hearing from parents
